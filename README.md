### Why?

This project is a basic example of how to create an operating system in assembly language. The project covers several fundamental aspects of operating system development including file system management, process management, interrupt handling, and network management.

The project starts by setting up the stack and segment registers, and then it proceeds to initialize the various subsystems of the operating system such as the file system manager, the process manager and the network manager. The main loop of the operating system is then executed, which repeatedly checks for new processes to schedule, handles incoming network packets and waits for interrupts.

The project also includes functions for creating, opening and deleting files, scheduling and executing processes, handling interrupts, and sending and receiving network packets. These functions demonstrate the basic concepts of how an operating system manages the various resources and tasks it is responsible for.

I chose to take on this project because I wanted to gain a better understanding of how operating systems work at a low level. Assembly language is a powerful tool for understanding the underlying hardware and how the operating system interacts with it. Additionally, this project also provided me with an opportunity to learn about the various subsystems of an operating system and how they work together to make a functional operating system.

It is worth noting that this is a basic example and a real operating system would require a much more complex codebase. Additionally, this code is for x86 architecture and different architectures may have different requirements for operating system development.

Furthermore, this project also provided me with the opportunity to work with various system-level programming concepts such as memory management, process scheduling, and device driver development. These concepts are fundamental to operating system development and are essential for building robust and efficient systems.

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was working with assembly language, which is a low-level programming language and requires a good understanding of the underlying hardware architecture. This requires a deep understanding of the instruction set and memory management techniques used in the architecture. However, the challenge of working with assembly language was also one of the most rewarding aspects of this project as it allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the underlying hardware and how the operating system interacts with it.

In conclusion, this project was a valuable learning experience that has greatly contributed to my understanding of operating systems and system-level programming concepts. I believe that the knowledge and skills I gained from this project will be valuable in my future endeavors in the field of operating systems. I will be also happy to take on similar projects in the future.
